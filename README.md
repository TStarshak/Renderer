# Renderer
This repo holds a program that I am using to expand my knowledge of computer graphics. Currently, the program supports a bounding volume hierarchy using octrees. 

This program was made using visual studio 2022 targetting x64 architecture. 

Compile the program using clang++ -std=c++14 -o main.exe main.cpp -O3
Run the program with main.exe
